To get started with your first local virtual server, you need to download and install Vagrant and
VirtualBox, and set up a simple Vagrantfile, which will describe the virtual server.
1. Download and install Vagrant and VirtualBox (whichever version is appropriate for your OS):
- Download Vagrant³⁸ - Download VirtualBox³⁹ (when installing, make sure the command
line tools are installed, so Vagrant work with it)
2. Create a new folder somewhere on your hard drive where you will keep your Vagrantfile and
provisioning instructions.
3. Open a Terminal or PowerShell window, then navigate to the folder you just created.
4. Add a CentOS 7.x 64-bit ‘box’ using the vagrant box add⁴⁰ command: vagrant box add
geerlingguy/centos7 (note: HashiCorp’s Atlas⁴¹ has a comprehensive list of different premade
Linux boxes. Also, check out the ‘official’ Vagrant Ubuntu boxes on the Vagrant wiki⁴².
5. Create a default virtual server configuration using the box you just downloaded: vagrant
init geerlingguy/centos7
6. Boot your CentOS server: vagrant up
Vagrant has downloaded a pre-built 64-bit CentOS 7 virtual machine (you can build your own⁴³
virtual machine ‘boxes’, if you so desire), loaded it into VirtualBox with the configuration defined
in the default Vagrantfile (which is now in the folder you created earlier), and booted the virtual
machine.
Managing this virtual server is extremely easy: vagrant halt will shut down the VM, vagrant up
will bring it back up, and vagrant destroy will completely delete the machine from VirtualBox. A
simple vagrant up again will re-create it from the base box you originally downloaded.
Now that you have a running server, you can use it just like you would any other server, and you
can connect via SSH. To connect, enter vagrant ssh from the folder where the Vagrantfile is located.
If you want to connect manually, or connect from another application, enter vagrant ssh-config
to get the required SSH details.
